# React + Vite

This is a React jsx project using Chakra UI in the design and implementation of the tasks <My Tasks>

The whole project is made using Chakra UI, from the navigation bar to the simple grids and the card components.

For more information about the UI, look at https://chakra-ui.com/ to get started. It easy to use and the documentations are
straightforward.

It was fun making this project and I will make another one using the same UI.
